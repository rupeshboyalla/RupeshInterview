 *
 * What is Abstraction in OOPS:
 * Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user,
 * only the functionality will be provided to the user. In other words,
 * the user will have the information on what the object does instead
 * of how it does it.
 *
 *
 * Abstract class should contains atleast one abstract method then only we
 * can declared it as abstract class.
 * 
 * An abstract method is an method which doesn't have any implementation it just have signature.
